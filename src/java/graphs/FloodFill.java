 * Floodfill is an algorithm that identifies and labels the connected component that a particular cell belongs to,
 * in a multi-dimensional array (implicit graph). It is DFS, on a grid and we want to find the connected component of all the
 * connected cells with the same number.
 *
 * When doing floodfill, we will maintain an N Ã— M array of booleans to keep track of which squares have been visited, and a
 * global variable to maintain the size of the current component we are visiting. Make sure to store the grid, the visited
 * array, dimensions, and the current size variable globally
